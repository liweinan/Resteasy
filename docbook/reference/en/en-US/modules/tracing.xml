    <title>RESTEasy Tracing Feature</title>
    <section>
        <title>Overview</title>
        <para>
            Tracing feature is a way for the users of the RESTEasy to understand what's going on internally in the
            container when a request is processed. It's different from the pure logging system or profiling feature,
            which
            provide more general information about the request and response.

            On the other hand, the tracing feature provides more internal states of the JAX-RS container. For example,
            it could be able to show what filters a request is going through, or how long time a request is processed
            and
            other kinds of information.

        <title>Tracing Info Level</title>
        <para>Currently it doesn't have a standard or spec to define the tracing feature, so the tracing feature is
            tightly coupled with the concrete JAX-RS implementation itself. The RESTEasy tracing feature supports three
            working modes:
        </para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>OFF</listitem>
            <listitem>ON_DEMAND</listitem>
            <listitem>ALL</listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>
            ALL will enable the tracing feature. ON_DEMAND mode will give the control to client side: A client can send
            a tracing request via HTTP header and get the tracing info back from response headers. OFF mode will disable
            the tracing feature, and this is the default mode.
